## My process

### Built with

- React
- ES6+
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)

### What I learned

I heavily used styled components in this project to practice it more (also with passing data via props to them). I'm getting more and more used to mobile-first workflow, transition to that was tough, beacuse on the beginning of my front-end journey I wasn't doing it, but right now it feels much easier to expand things rather than shrinking them.
